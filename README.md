# Movie-Centric(Movie Hub App)
Welcome to my movie App "Movie-Centric". A dynamic app that I created in React.js that is meant to be center for all movies
new and old. Using the TMDB API you are able to explore and view information on all your favorite movies.
From popular, to upcoming, even today's top-rated movies. What? your favorite movie is not in either of those categories?
Well movie-centric has search capabilites that allow you to look up all your favorite movies in the TMDB database and the movies
related to it; as well as viewing information about it along with trailers and movie-clips.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- React.js
- React Router DOM
- React Responsive Carousel
- React Loading Skeleton
- React Youtube
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## How to get started (Packages you may need)
### `npm i react-router-dom`
This will allow you to set up routes for your webpage and application, also it allows
you to create links to which you can go to the speicific route your require.
### `npm i react-responsive-carousel`
This will allow you to create an automatic slideshow of images of your choice where you can control
 duration, transition time, and auto play properties of the slideshow,
### `npm i react-loading-skeleton`
During the time period of the page loading(typically during a useEffect API call) this installation allows you
to create a loading effect that can be styled in place of where the objects on the page will
eventually be loaded to.
### `npm i react-youtube`
This installation partnered with a videoID from the TMDB API allows you to display Youtube videos in
your application. These videos can play on demand, and can start stop like a normal youtube video.
### `npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`
### `npm i --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icon`
### `npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`
These installations import the ability for react to use solid, regular, and brand icons from font awesome
in your projects.
